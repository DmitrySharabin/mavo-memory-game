# Project #2. Memory Game
The Memory Game Project is the second self-paced project in _Udacity Nanodegree Program_.

_Memory Game_ is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as _Concentration_). For more information see this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) in Wikipedia.

## How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen “cards” arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The game supports three different sets of symbols — themes: _emoji_, _flora_, _animals_.

The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

## Gameplay
The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
